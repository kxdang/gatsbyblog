              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                Hello, my name is Kien Dang. I have a Bachelors of Science in
                Honours Biochemistry from the University of Waterloo. Iâ€™ve held
                many job positions while I was in co-op ranging from lab
                research to corporate positions.
                <br />
                <br />I love technology ranging from computers, phones to cars.
                Iâ€™m a self motivated learner who likes to program and one of my
                favourite things to do is try to automate tasks I encounter
                every day and improve the quality of life through science and
                technology.
                <br />
                <br />
                My blog is a platform to share my experiences, interests,
                hobbies and current progress with programming. In addition, I
                hope to become a better writer by blogging. Feel free to browse
                around!{" "}
