I recently found out about Shopify's Dev Degree program and quickly wanted something up and running. This was a big motivator for me to finally create a personal portfolio.

I stumbled on a template from Gatsby by a person named <a href="https://github.com/greglobinski/www.greglobinski.com" target="_blank">Greg lobinski</a> and really loved the simplistic design. I forked it and ended up tweaking the UI to my liking. The template already had implemented SASS/SCSS and a BEM structure which became a perfect opportunity to apply the concepts I've been learning from an Advanced CSS and SASS course on Udemy.

What was interesting to me is that CSS can be applied different ways to build websites. For example, this blog currently uses something called <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html" target="_blank">CSS-in-JS</a>, a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of external files. I picked up CSS-in-JS from learning how to build this blog and after learning about the BEM structure approach with SCSS, I can see the pros and cons to both methods and much prefer the structure of external files

It is nice to see how others implement the BEM structure in a React project. I can confidently navigate through a project to know how to achieve my desired result. Overall, I'm happy with the way it turned out!

The changes I made below:

- The overall colour scheme, I found inspiration from colorhunt.com
- <a href="https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons" target="_blank">Migration from React-icons v2 to v3 </a>
- Adding a bigger personal picture and center aligned the design for the first page
- Added a small snippet of text below to redirect to this blog
- Added information to the projects page using React
