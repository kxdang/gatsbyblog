I recently found out about Shopify's Dev Degree program and quickly wanted something up and running. This was a big motivator for me to finally create a personal portfolio.

I stumbled on a template from Gatsby by a person named <a href="https://github.com/greglobinski/www.greglobinski.com" target="_blank">Greg lobinski</a> and really loved the simplistic design. I forked it and ended up tweaking the UI to my liking. The template already had implemented SASS/SCSS and a BEM structure which became a perfect opportunity to apply the concepts I've been learning from an Advanced CSS and SASS course on Udemy.

I picked up CSS-in-JS from learning how to build this blog and after learning about the BEM structure approach with SCSS, I can see the pros and cons to both methods and much prefer the structure of external files

It is nice to see how others implement the BEM structure in a React project. I can confidently navigate through a project to know how to achieve my desired result. Overall, I'm happy with the way it turned out!

The changes I made below:

- The overall colour scheme, I found inspiration from <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank">colorhunt</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons" target="_blank">Migration from React-icons v2 to v3 </a>
- Adding a bigger personal picture and center aligned the design for the first page
- Added a small snippet of text below to redirect to this blog
- Added information to the projects page using React
