I've completed 20 [Pomodoro's](/022-pomodoro-technique/) (500 minutes) in June. This is a decrease of 40 Pomodoro's compared to [last month](/090-may-2020-pomodoro), a difference of 1000 minutes. Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. 

It helps me stay accountable in my journey as a lifelong learner and studying the material I am interested in which will help me become a better developer and also keeping my skills current and up to date.

## <center>Self Reflection</center>

I was expecting a low Pomodoro count this month which was predicted last month to be about 20-35. Due to the current events that have happened last month where I am currently ramping up during my employment.

I realized that I have not been working on algorithms and data structures as I previously wanted to do. I believe it's because I am currently learning a lot at work, thus, avoiding new concepts that are a bit more taxing to learn after work.

I am currently working on managing stress by taking my time after work to go for a run and then follow up with yoga and meditation. I think once I have devloped a nice routine, I will start slowly start ramping my Pomodoro's for studying. 



I am cautious not to over extend my productivity as I will be going into surgery next week which will have a big impact on my Pomodoros.


## <center>June Improvements</center>

#### <center>work</center>
This month, I dedicated some time to learn React and Redux after work which has helped me understand Redux more and making me more confident in understanding the workings of a React-Redux project.

I have created a Phillip's Hue routine timer at during work to incorporate my Pomodoro's which involves turning my lights dark blue for 25 minutes which is the same colour as my VSCode editor to enhance my environment for <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">Deep Work</a>.

#### <center>TOOLS</center>
I have completed a course called <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/customize-vs-code/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code Can Do That?</a> by Burke Holland. Since I was going to live in VSCode, I wanted to explore some neat tricks and powerful extensions to improve my overall workflow and productivity at work and for my personal gain.

I am using <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> create notes and connecting concepts together. I find it very enjoyable to work with and I will be making a post about how I use this tool to accelerate my learning both at work and for personal use.

#### <center>PERSONAL</center>
I have converted all of my CSS from my personal blog over to SCSS. This was something that I have been wanting to do for quite some time and spent the weekend structuring my blog files.

Trying to implement a routine after work and so far I am about 3 weeks in.
- Running before dinner
- Yoga after running
- Meditation before bed

#### <center>Personal Development Book</center>
I picked up a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport and it is in my book rotation for this month along with 3 others found on my now page.
