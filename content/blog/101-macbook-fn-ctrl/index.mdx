I wanted to share this quick step by step on how to remap the MacBook Pro 16" (2019) fn key to act as the option key on MacOS (ctrl to windows). I have always been a PC user. Adjusting to the placement of the command key was difficult when I would try to do ctrl+c/v for copy and pasting.

You will need to download and install a free tool called <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner-Elements</a>.

# Step 1:
- Download and install Karabiner-Elements 
- Open the tool and do the prompt to enable the Security & Privacy settings
- Click on Apple Icon (top left) and hit `System preferences...`
- Make sure the lock is unlocked and check mark both the `karabiner_grabber` and `karabiner_observer`

Make sure you allow both `karabiner_grabber` and `karabiner_observer` in Input Monitoring.

If you do not see the `karabiner_grabber`, right click the `karabiner_observer` and click on the `Show in Finder`. Drag the `karabiner_grabber` from the folder into the list of App section if the Security & Privacy window and enable it.

# Step 2:
Open the `Karabiner-Elements` and map as seen below `fn` to `left_command`.

You will still be able to access the fn key functionality for your touch bar and will function as normal. Other shortcut commands like fn+c/v will function just like how you would expect when using ctrl on Windows, thus sacrificing close to nothing when you switch over with the shortcut commands between operating systems
