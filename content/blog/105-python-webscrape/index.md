description: How to web scrape with Python in 2020. A complete beginners guide on how to check any site for changes and generate an email notification when it changes.

It's been quite sometime since I programmed with Python. I started diving into Al Sweigart's Automate The Boring Stuff with Python book shortly after university to learn basic programming and eventually stopped after landing my first full time job.

I decided to jump back into Python to spice up the scenery a bit and keep myself fresh from staring at JavaScript all day. I created a Python bot to constantly check a website for a specific item and notify me when its in stock. I was looking for a specific projector that did not have a **notify me when in stock** button on their site. Lame.

For this guide, I will provide brief explanation of my code and hopefully you can get this running on your own machine.


_Disclaimer: Please web scrape at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything beyond my control. I will assume you have Python v3 setup and know Python._

# Step 1: Import the libraries.
First, we will need a few libraries. 

- Request is a very simple HTTP library for Python. We will be utilizing this to send an HTTP request.
- BeautifulSoup will allow us to pull data out of HTML and XML files.
- smtplib is a library that will allow you to send emails for notifications

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import smtplib
```

# Step 2: Accessing the web using Python.
In order to utilize the request library we imported, we need to access the `request.get()` method and pass in your URL you want to scrape. Below I am storing it in as a variable called `response`.

Next, we will use the BeautifulSoup library and pass in the data we get back from response as the first argument and in the second argument we put `html.parser`

```python
URL = 'yourwebsiteyouwannascrape.com'
response = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

```

Nice. Now if you end up printing out the data `soup` in our Python file `print(soup)` you'll end up printing out the DOM like how would see in the inspect element of your browser.

# Step 3: Select the element

Now, we want to select the element you want to keep track of. It could be something specific on the page or a text.

In order to do this, you use the BeautifulSoup `select` method to select the `div` element or whichever element you want and then follow the syntax below to access its class. 

For this example, I stored my element in a variable called `OOS` because the element it selects shows an **OUT OF STOCK** div.

```python
OOS = soup.select("div.promo-bug.out")
# this checks for the class names in a div element 
# e.g <div class="promo-bug out"/>
# soup.text will give you the text if theres 1 match
#
# If there's more than 1 match:
# soup.select() returns a list of all matches, 
# so you can iterate each item with a loop
```

# Step 4: Apply the logic and notify!

I recommend you create a dummy Gmail account for your bot. You can enter the credentials below to get this to work. Mind you, the email might go to the junk mail so make sure to whitelist it!

Now this last step is basically checking whether this element exists or not in web page. I ended up using Python's built in `len` method because the `select` method returns the data in an array.

If my array has a length of one, then we know that element is showing in the HTML. If it doesn't, well, that means it disappeared and something has changed. That's when I'll send out the email.

Also, if the text changes for whatever reason, you can change the conditional to check whether the text is a different value. This is useful if you are checking if a price drops.

```python{numberLines: true}
print(len(OOS))
# This will show ["<div class="promo-bug out"/>"]

if len(OOS) == 1:
    print('OUT OF STOCK ITEM')

else:
    print('IN STOCK')
    msg = 'Subject: Hello, there is stock!'
    fromaddr = 'YOURBOT@gmail.com'
    toaddrs = 'TOADDRESS@gmail.com'

    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login("YOURBOT@gmail.com", "GMAIL PASSWORD")
    server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)
    server.quit()

    print('From: ' + fromaddr)
    print('To: ' + str(toaddrs))
    print('Message: ' + msg)
```

This is where we utilize the `smtplib` library. The code above starting from server is all boilerplate code I found <a href="https://stackabuse.com/how-to-send-emails-with-gmail-using-python/" target="_blank">here</a>. 

And there you have it! A BOT that will send you an email if something changes.

# Conclusion
This is a very simple implementation. You basically will need to run this script multiple times in your command line to get this to work. I recommend trying out a Raspberry Pi and using a crontab to trigger this script every 30 minutes (only works for Linux based system)

Another way to handle this as well is to use a scheduler library found <a href="https://pypi.org/project/schedule/" target="_blank">here</a>. In my next post, I'll show you how to do both.

Instead of email, I'll have a quick tutorial on how to setup a 24/7 telegram bot on a Raspberry Pi to send you a text notification instead of having to run your computer.
