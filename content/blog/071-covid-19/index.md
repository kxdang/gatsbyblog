Ontario is officially in a state of emergency amid COVID-19 outbreak.

The COVID-19 outbreak affects everyone, it causes illness, the economy declines as many employees are laid off which leaves many who work unable to provide for themselves or their families and future plans cancelled.

Looks like March of 2020 really hit the peak of COVID-19 news. Earlier this month, I return to Canada from Amsterdam; I'm slightly jet lagged coming from a 6-hr time difference. The night I slept super early in the comfort of my own bed, I missed the news that <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/coronavirus-what-to-know-as-nba-suspends-season-after-rudy-gobert-tests-positive-for-covid-19/" target="_blank">NBA has suspended the season</a> after a player tested positive for COVID-19 and Trump suspends travel from Europe to US causing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/investing/stock-futures-coronavirus-trump/index.html" target="_blank">bear market.</a>

Shortly after the news broke, other <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/coronavirus-live-updates-japan-olympic-committee-deputy-head-has-covid-19-kentucky-derby-postponed/live/" target="\_blank">US sport organizations</a> go on pause for 8 weeks and panic buying cause toilet paper to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6651464/covid-19-panic-buying-shortages/" target="_blank">fly off the shelf.</a> Ontario closes public schools and Universities for an extra week during March break and many other countries closing tourist areas, including the Anne Frank house we were in earlier last week.

Today, Doug Ford declares a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/coronavirus-covid-19-ontario-tuesday-1.5500006" target="_blank">state of emergency</a> due to the COVID-19 outbreak causing restaurants to close and only do takeout, social events with 50 or greater to be cancelled as well as theatres and other recreational centers. However, all vital business will not be affected and remain open.

It seems like the moment I came home, everything literally changed overnight. It is insane to realize how something so small like a virus do so much damage.

One major problem during an outbreak is the strain it has on the health care system. Health Ontario advises to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6680786/ontario-hospitals-coronavirus-elective-surgeries/" target="_blank">ramp down elective surgeries</a> to help preserve capacity. As a result, my third and last surgery has been cancelled until further notice.

Unfortunately, that means my timeline for a career change has been delayed as I need to consider the post-surgery recovery time and wait for the COVID-19 outbreak to settle.

During this time, I will still dedicate to learning and exploring the new technologies by building applications from the skills I have acquired in the past few months.
