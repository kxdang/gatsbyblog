I‚Äôve completed (+3) more pomodoros than [last month](/049-july-2019-pomodoro/). July was not a fun time for me, 4 trips to the ER and a bunch of pills later and I‚Äôm looking back still amazed how well Pomodoros have been working for me.

Taking a look at my August pomodoros shows a very similar trend. I‚Äôve been hit with a slow brewing infection upon recovery and figured August would be a write off. Doing 2 pomodoros per day was enough for me, that's only 50 minutes of focused work and anything more than that I would probably doze off from the [medication](/053-cipro-zzz/) I was on.

I realized that having a solid system such as the Pomodoro technique is essential for building momentum and help bring back a productive routine. I‚Äôm hoping that once I‚Äôm cleared I can go back to hitting my 8 pomodoros daily.
