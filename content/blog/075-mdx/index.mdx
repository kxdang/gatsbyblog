<p style={{paddingTop: "2rem"}}>For the past month, I've been learning React which has slowly given me the confidence to tweak my blog. Recently, I added support for multiple tags in a post and having GraphQL to properly query for them. </p>

In addition, I added a nicer button to toggle between dark and light mode, something I've been meaning to figure out how to do. After learning how to use external libraries, I went ahead and installed a Switch component for React and viola, cooler button!

I am always looking for improvements because I have fun while doing them. Whether its self-improvements or small optimizations to my own process, I know they will compound over time.

Today I added <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/" target="_blank">MDX</a>  support which allows me to insert JSX into markdown files. 

Having both markdown and JSX is a perfect combination for my blog to add interactive graphs for my monthly Pomodoro reports. In turn, this helps build a lot of momentum in my journey since these graphs are fun to make and look relatively nice.

I followed the mdx conversion guide <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-11-21-how-to-convert-an-existing-gatsby-blog-to-use-mdx/" target="_blank">here</a> and found that I had to do a lot more refactoring as I had my remark-reading-time plugin installed and my tags page all hooked up to the inital starter blog setup. After 3 hours of tinkering, I finally got it to work! A <a href="https://github.com/kxdang/kiendang.me/commit/aa7a4cd9b7802e8ae8205a873ce1e9fe348e0df3#diff-ca94906dec2dec0df15659daa3b08a63" target="_blank">code comparison</a> on how I managed to switch over to MDX. I had to deal with fixing href on my MD files.

I am using a React wrapper for Chartjs and then importing them in my markdown. Now I can make my blog look a little more technical!
