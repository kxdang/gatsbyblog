A very eventful two weeks of October.

UFC 229, McGregor vs Nurmagomedov, Microsoft Surface refreshes, Google Pixel 3 release, and new Google hardware... but nothing beats having a good meal with friends and family.

Every year on October, I've noticed many companies release a lot of new products, perfectly timed before for Black Friday and Christmas. Sometimes its best to forget all those marketed hypes of new technology and just be thankful for food.

It's very tempting every year to dump money on a new gadget, especially when they're on a very large discount. But I think this Black Friday, I'll be keeping the money in my wallet.

My SO is the best when it comes to cooking meals, she cooked ham this year and it was delicious.

Happy Thanksgiving.
