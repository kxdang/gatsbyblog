I've completed 90 [Pomodoro's](/022-pomodoro-technique/) (2250 minutes) in December. This is a decrease of 2 Pomodoro's compared to [last month](/063-november-2019-pomodoro/), a difference of 50 minutes.

Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. It helps me stay accountable in my journey in completing a MERN Udemy course and becoming a self-taught developer.

Now that 2019 is officially over, I think it's a good idea to clump December's Pomodoro with a year end summary. I officially started reflecting my Pomodoro's back in July shortly after [I resigned back in May](/041-the-jump/). A summary of my accomplishments this year, I hoping for a better year in 2020!

# <center>Reflection</center>

In the beginning of 2019, I decided to learn how to make applications and started with android for a bit, I quickly realized it was very difficult not coming from any background in CS.

I quickly burned out after the initial motivation from January; Pomodoro's were supposed to keep me focused but I had no energy left after work. 

I noticed when you're staring at the computer all day for work, the last thing you want to do is have your eyes glued to the monitor when you're at home. I made the decision to resign to free up time and energy from a position that didn't align with my career goals.

I jumped into React after learning HTML and CSS. I knew enough React to start playing with Gatsby and read through the documentation to start my blog. I was missing the fundamentals with JavaScript so I decided to back peddle by taking a JavaScript modern bootcamp and then a Nodejs course to iron out any missing knowledge.

### <center>The highs and lows</center>

Unfortunately, a month after my resignation I was hit with a terrible infection which left me unable to focus for months. 

After four exhausting months of recovery, taking [9 courses of antibiotics](/tags/biochemistry/), [4 different opioids](/062-opioids/) and having 2 surgeries, I stuck with my <a href="https://dev.to/kdang/trust-the-process-the-pomodoro-technique-2a37" target="_blank">Pomodoro process</a> to build momentum and managed to complete two online courses and create my personal blog using Gatsby. 

The most important lesson I've learned this year is that things will never go according to plan and life just gets in the way. There are factors outside of our control and we'll just have to find a way to deal with them. 

Despite being through a lot of physical pain and mental exhaustion, I learned a lot about myself and how I deal with hardships. I found that being healthy is a blessing and that it's usually taken for granted until you become sick.
