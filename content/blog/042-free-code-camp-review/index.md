I’ve done many courses on HTML and CSS from Udemy courses, Treehouse and W3School. Over the years this was something I learned by myself and used lots of resources online. Understanding how to use frameworks like Bootstrap help me edit websites and tailor them to how I want them to look.

I decided to brush up on my HTML and CSS since it has been awhile. freeCodeCamp is an excellent resource for this. They provide problems that require you to use HTML and CSS to solve them. What’s great about this course is that it focuses heavily on Applied HTML Accessibility which is something I’ve never dealt with in depth. It also taught me new concepts of CSS’s new offerings which are CSS Flex Box and CSS Grid layout.

When completing the curriculum, there were 5 milestone projects to help the user re-apply what they’ve learned. You are required to pass in order to receive the certification. I received my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/kxdang/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">certification</a> on May 11th.

I look forward to doing the JavaScript curriculum offered by freeCodeCamp. I think it’s time for me to start my Algorithm course alongside my JavaScript.
