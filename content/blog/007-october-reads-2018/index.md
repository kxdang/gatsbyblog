Reading is a great way to exercise the brain. The benefits include having a more focused mind, an increased attention span, and improving grammar skills.

Since Halloween is approaching, I thought I'd share some mystery-thriller novels that will send some chills down your spine.

#### **Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man’s Fight for Justice**

The perfect book for the fall as this nonfiction political thriller sends you down straight into the Kremlin. The author, Bill Browder, tells his story about doing business in Russia and eventually uncovers disturbing news. As you progress through this book, you will see how everything unfolds. A real-life thriller with news you can uncover and Google while reading it. I highly recommend this book.

#### **And Then There Were None**

I must read during Halloween. There were 10 strangers invited into a small island owned by an unknown millionaire. All of them die without any evidence of an 11th person. A Reddit user recommended this book and says to read on your death bed because you will never see life the same again.

#### **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**

Alright, I had to put this one up here. It is an international bestseller for a reason. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development and the plot. Sweden's wealthiest family member disappear for years and was never found. The uncle hires a famous journalist (Mikael) to investigate and eventually stumbles upon Lisbeth (The dragon-tattooed girl) whose a genius hacker and aids him in the investigation. During their journey, they uncover Sweden's corruption and darkest secrets which eventually leads them to the answer.
